UC DAVIS report : http://gsm.ucdavis.edu/sites/main/files/file-attachments/03_information_decay_and_financial_disclosures.pdf

#### dataset covers a period from March, 2003 to ?, 2016.

Short-term event studies generally find that the bulk of content in an information release is
quickly incorporated into stock prices.

For example, an upcoming financial disclosure
by Home Depot could cause a concomitant demand for historical disclosures by Home Depot or
recent vintage disclosures by Lowe’s. 

After providing some descriptive views of the data, many of which are similar to other
studies using a shorter time series, we consider, for the most common EDGAR disclosures, the
decay rate for server requests over the year following a form’s filing


With the EDGAR data, it is critical to separate requests generated by robots from server
requests by regular investors (e.g., non-robots). For example, the activity of a computer program
designed to download all 10-Ks is not representative of targeted information requests by
individual investors or analysts


>>>>> check 10-k filing date for a company and check subsequrnt stock price change
can be due to robotic hits
